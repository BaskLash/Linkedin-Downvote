## 🚀 Overview

**LinkedIn Downvote** is a lightweight browser extension concept that introduces a long-requested feature:  
a **dislike / downvote** mechanism for LinkedIn posts, allowing users to **express disapproval** or **signal low-quality content** in a constructive way.

While LinkedIn emphasizes positive interactions, this project demonstrates how user feedback tools could evolve to improve **content quality**, **relevance**, and **authentic engagement** on professional platforms.

---

## 💡 How It Works

- 🧩 **Browser Extension:** Injects a clean “👎 Downvote” button into LinkedIn posts.  
- ⚙️ **Lightweight Script:** Listens for post rendering and adds interactive vote tracking elements.  
- 📊 **Local or Sync Storage:** Keeps track of your personal votes directly in your browser.  
- 🔒 **Privacy First:** No data leaves your browser — everything is stored locally.  
- 🧠 **Optional Enhancements (future):**
  - Aggregate anonymous downvotes for content insights.
  - Integrate with personal feed filters.

*(Note: This project is an independent concept and not affiliated with LinkedIn.)*
